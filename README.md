# Discussion-Forum

A discussion forum is a web-based application that provides a medium to share knowledge about what you’ve learned from your studies and experiences. Discussion forum helps to emphasize important concepts covered in a particular module or to elaborate on a topic that the course lecture or readings didn’t cover in depth. It allows users to share their thoughts and opinions, ask questions, and gain insights from other forum members. It is a great way for people to connect and learn from one another. They can also facilitate debates and discussions, allowing people to think critically and share their perspectives.
The main aim of an online group discussion forum is to create an interactive platform where students can collaborate, share ideas, and engage in discussions with their peers and teachers. The admin can also use the system to monitor and moderate the discussions, provide feedback, and make announcements.
